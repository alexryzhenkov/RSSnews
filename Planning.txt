RSS reader project.

General idea: Python is used for analysing RSS feed stream.
              Python stores RSSFeed in Mongo or SQL
              Express+React for showing results and controlling analytics.

Making project: MVP Based idea. After some point move everything to docker.

Iteration 1.
    Database which stores RSS feed adresses.
    Python script takes adresses -> read first post from each feed -> stores it to the DB.
    Web app: 
            Show first post from each feed to user.
            Add new RSS feeds.
            Refresh python script.
